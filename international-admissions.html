      <h2>International Admissions at Veritas University</h2>
      <p>Veritas University is proud to welcome students from all around the world. If you are an international student considering studying at Veritas, we are here to help you navigate the admissions process and make your transition to life in the United States as smooth as possible.</p>
      <h3>Admission Requirements</h3>
      <p>International students must meet the same admission requirements as domestic students, but there are a few additional steps that you will need to take. For example, you will need to provide proof of English proficiency, either through TOEFL or IELTS scores, or by completing the English as a Second Language (ESL) program. You will also need to provide documentation of your financial resources, as well as a copy of your passport. For a complete list of admission requirements, please visit the international admissions website.</p>
      <h3>Visa Information</h3>
      <p>Once you have been accepted to Veritas University, you will need to obtain a student visa in order to study in the United States. The process for obtaining a student visa can be complex, so we recommend starting early and seeking the advice of a qualified immigration attorney. Veritas University can also provide you with information about obtaining a student visa and help you to complete the necessary paperwork. For more information about student visas, please visit the international admissions website.</p>
      <h3>Adjusting to Life in the United States</h3>
      <p>Adjusting to life in a new country can be challenging, especially if you are coming from a very different cultural background. Veritas University is committed to supporting our international students and helping them to succeed both academically and personally. We offer a range of resources and services to help you adjust to life in the United States, including:</p>
      <ul>
